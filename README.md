#Ring Game!

## Creative-WebCam_KNOX

## About
This project uses your camera to track you face and follow where your nose goes. The point of the game is to try and get the dark ring onto the other circles! They don't move, but 
depending on how you move will make it more diificult or harder. 
As well as moving the ring, it also tracks your movements in order to to change the background! The colours change as you move to make it more fun. :)

### Influence
I mostly really liked the way we were able to create effects in class, and after scrolling through the p5 showcase I just really like the idea of playing with colour and shapes.
